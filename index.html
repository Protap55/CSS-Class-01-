            Pakistani player Kamran Akmal called out that strong leadership is needed within the PCB. He stressed the fact that the PCB should present powerful leadership in this matter that could benefit Pakistan’s image around the world. He further slammed India for refusing to visit Pakistan saying that it was not for the first time BCCI made such a move. India did not travel to Pakistan for Asia Cup last year as all matches were played in Sri Lanka, even the final one.
